## Getting started
The SMS service is in test account therefore can send sms only to whitelisted mobile number. Currently, only my number is in the list.
When you wish to send an SMS to a different number (such as yourself), ping me and I'll add the number.     
Then you'll get a confirmation code which you'll also need to send it to me. Wait for my confirmation that number is indeed whitelisted.

And that's about it. Once confirmed, You can send sms to that number.
